# Getting Started

To start using byorg.ai, you don't need an extensive setup. All you need is an LLM provider of your choice.

## Pre-requisites

- API keys to LLM Provider supported by Vercel's AI SDK (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, ...) [complete list here](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

:::tip
You can even use a self-hosted LLM, as long as it is compatible with the Vercel AI SDK.

## Installation

The easiest way to begin is by installing byorg.ai packages and `ai` package using your preferred package manager.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @callstack/byorg-core ai" />

In the next section, we'll demonstrate how to use our core library to handle your requests.
